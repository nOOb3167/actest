Assuming Allegro initially loads an Ortho,
loading a Perspective over that... Is not the brightest idea

Sanitycheck their Viewport, Projection, ModelView

Positive X Right
Positive Z Down
Positive Y Inbound

Notice there is a regression
from 7b40e77457b41c3dc565f6078d5d1f20f1906862
to where gluPerspective is first used:
The depth texture (dtex) draws as full white.
Which is 'solved' by... err 90 FOV, 1.0 nearplane, 5.0 farplane apparently.

Remember the shape of z_eye to z_w mapping function.
With the original 0.1 nearplane, 10.0 farplane, it is possible that the
cube (translated on z-axis by -3.8, with min coordinate -1, max coordinate +1)
was far enough in for the values to be indistingishable from pure white while
rendering.

With the z-buffer texture being 24-bit Depth Component,
and the framebuffer being 8-bit RGB Components,
24-8=16, 2^16 z-buffer values map to the same RGB color.

RGB 0 = 0, 1 = 2^8 || DC 0 = 0, 1 = 2^24
RGB 1/256 = 2^8 / 2^8 = 1 || DC 1/256 = 2^24 / 2^8
